# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions

    # fill in your code below
    
    # convert number to a name using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!
    # all valid return values are not an empty string.
    # empty string is returned on an error.
